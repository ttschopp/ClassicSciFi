          <h3>biography</h3>
          <p>Ray Bradbury, in full Ray Douglas Bradbury, (born August 22, 1920, Waukegan, Illinois, U.S.—died June 5, 2012, Los Angeles, California), American author best known for his highly imaginative short stories and novels that blend a poetic style, nostalgia for childhood, social criticism, and an awareness of the hazards of runaway technology.</p>
          <p>In the mid-1940s Bradbury’s stories started to appear in major magazines such as The American Mercury, Harper’s, and McCall’s, and he was unusual in publishing both in pulp magazines such as Planet Stories and Thrilling Wonder Stories and &quot;slicks&quot; (so-called because of their high-quality paper) such as The New Yorker and Collier’s without leaving behind the genres he loved. &quot;The Martian Chronicles&quot; (1950), a series of short stories, depicts Earth’s colonization of Mars, which leads to the extinction of an idyllic Martian civilization. However, in the face of an oncoming nuclear war, many of the settlers return to Earth, and after Earth’s destruction, a few surviving humans return to Mars to become the new Martians. The short-story collection &quot;The Illustrated Man&quot; (1951) included one of his most famous stories, &quot;The Veldt,&quot; in which a mother and father are concerned about the effect their house’s simulation of lions on the African veldt is having on their children.</p>
          <p>Bradbury’s next novel, &quot;Fahrenheit 451&quot; (1953), is regarded as his greatest work. In a future society where books are forbidden, Guy Montag, a &quot;fireman&quot; whose job is the burning of books, takes a book and is seduced by reading. Fahrenheit 451 has been acclaimed for its anti-censorship themes and its defense of literature against the encroachment of electronic media. An acclaimed film adaptation was released in 1966.</p>
          <p>The collection &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot; (1953) contained &quot;The Fog Horn&quot; (loosely adapted for film as &quot;The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms&quot; [1953]), about two lighthouse keepers’ terrifying encounter with a sea monster; the title story, about a rocket’s dangerous journey to scoop up a piece of the Sun; and &quot;A Sound of Thunder,&quot; about a safari back to the Mesozoic to hunt a Tyrannosaurus. In 1954 Bradbury spent six months in Ireland with director John Huston working on the screenplay for the film &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (1956), an experience Bradbury later fictionalized in his novel Green Shadows, &quot;White Whale&quot; (1992). After the release of &quot;Moby Dick&quot;, Bradbury was in demand as a screenwriter in Hollywood and wrote scripts for Playhouse 90, Alfred Hitchcock Presents, and The Twilight Zone.</p>
          <p>One of Bradbury’s most personal works, &quot;Dandelion Wine&quot; (1957), is an autobiographical novel about a magical but too brief summer of a 12-year-old boy in Green Town, Illinois (a fictionalized version of his childhood home of Waukegan). His next collection, &quot;A Medicine for Melancholy&quot; (1959), contained &quot;All Summer in a Day,&quot; a poignant story of childhood cruelty on Venus, where the Sun comes out only every seven years. The Midwest of his childhood was once again the setting of &quot;Something Wicked This Way Comes&quot; (1962), in which a carnival comes to town run by the mysterious and evil Mr. Dark.</p>
