          <h3>biography</h3>
          <p>Born on January 2, 1920, in Petrovichi, Russia, Isaac Asimov immigrated with his family to the United States and became a biochemistry professor while pursuing writing. He published his first novel, &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;, in 1950. An immensely prolific author who penned nearly 500 books, he published influential sci-fi works like &quot;I, Robot&quot; and the &quot;Foundation&quot; trilogy, as well as books in a variety of other genres. Asimov died in New York City on April 6, 1992.</p>
          <p>Isaac Asimov was fond of learning at a young age, having taught himself to read by the age of 5; he learned Yiddish soon after, and graduated from high school at 15 to enter Columbia University. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in 1939 and went on to get his M.A. and Ph.D. from the same institution. In 1942, he wed Gertrude Blugerman.</p>
          <p>In 1949, Asimov began a stint at Boston University School of Medicine, where he was hired as an associate professor of biochemistry in 1955. He eventually became a professor at the university by the late 1970s, though by that time he'd given up full-time teaching to do occasional lectures.</p>
          <p>Yet even with his impeccable academic credentials, writing for general readers was to be the professor's passion. Asimov's first short story to be sold, "Marooned Off Vesta," was published in Amazing Stories in 1938. Years later, he published his first book in 1950, the sci-fi novel &quot;Pebble in the Sky&quot;â€”the first in a line of titles that would mark a highly prolific writing career.</p>
          <p>An influential vision came with another 1950 release, the story collection &quot;I, Robot&quot;, which looked at human/construct relationships and featured the Three Laws of Robotics. (The narrative would be adapted for a blockbuster starring Will Smith decades later.) Asimov would later be credited with coming up with the term "robotics."</p>
          <p>Over the course of his career, Asimov won several Hugo and Nebula Awards, as well as received accolades from science institutions. He stated during a televised interview that he hoped his ideas would live on past his death; his wish has come to fruition, with the world continuing to contemplate his literary and scientific legacies.</p>
